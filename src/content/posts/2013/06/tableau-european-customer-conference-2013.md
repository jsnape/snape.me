![](./viz.png)This week has been dominated by the [Tableau Customer Conference](http://conference.tableausoftware.com/eu/2013/). I was fortunate to get a ticket since it was sold out but one of our architects couldn’t go so I filled in. I’m glad I did.

It’s been a while since I got to learn about a completely new technology so it is a refreshing change to be a bit of a novice. After a number of Microsoft conferences this one felt quite different too – less geeky with a more mixed crowd. It was interesting to be able to talk with non-technical types such as data analysts, business managers and statisticians.

I mainly went to the technical sessions but a couple of the keynote sessions were really interesting. Firstly ‘Creating a culture of data at Facebook’ gave some useful ideas about creating communities and getting more staff comfortable with visualizations. It was also nice to listen to a [blogger I’ve read for a while](http://vizwiz.blogspot.co.uk/) (but only just discovered worked for Facebook). The second was [Prof. Hans Rosling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling). I’ve seen his [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html) but in person was completely different – probably because he was talking to a room full of [data visualisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization "Data visualization") professionals. He had plenty of anecdotes about how his famous visualizations came about. [Ellie Fields gives a good description of his talk](http://www.tableausoftware.com/about/blog/2013/6/legend-flesh-hans-rosling-keynotes-tcceu13-23677).

So back to the day job now but with some new ideas about business intelligence and data visualization.
